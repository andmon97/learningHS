# Learning Haskell

There are some Haskell scripts from "Programming in Haskell" (Graham Hutton, 2007) and some excercises.
I made this exercises for my exam "Formal Methods in Computer Science".

## Installation

Haskell 2010 is used. You can download and install it via Chocolatey. VS Code was also used with the Haskell extension.
For the installation via Chocolatey follow the instructions [here]. (https://www.haskell.org/platform/windows.html)
